<br>
The ESP-RFID-Tool is a tool created for logging Wiegand data and also for testing devices that contain a Wiegand Interface.  The primary target group is 26-37bit HID Cards but it will also work with most devices that output Wiegand data.  ESP-RFID-Tool can be combined with a RFID reader and a battery to create a portable standalone RFID badge logger, it can also be integrated into existing systems without the need for a battery and instead drawing its power directly from the wiring in the existing installation. The ESP-RFID-Tool can read the data from any device that contains a Wiegand Interface and outputs data from 1 bit long up to 4,096 bits long, although anything other than 26-37bit is experimental.  The ESP-RFID-Tool is not even limited to RFID technologies, many other devices also contain a Wiegand Interface as it is an access control system standard, this includes pin pads(keypad), magnetic stripe(magstripe), there are even non access control related devices that utilize a Wiegand Interface.<br>
